Considering the different datasets available and the intended analyses to be carried out, the expected outcome of this report has been revised. 
Stakeholders now have different recommendations depending on how a decision between both cities applies to them.

Property developers: 
  a) As a new entrant, a developer would have to consider the existing level of competition in both cities. 
  b) The expected level of students per year across the main institutions in both cities will determine potential market size
  c) Perhaps the recommendation for students will also be factored in to some extent, as it provides a means to align strategy with the expected student behaviour
  d) Long term, a need to convert from PBSA to residential flats may arise. Should that be the case, the typical market for this type of accommodation would be early to middle-aged working professionals. As such, some information on employment in both cities would be beneficial. 
  
Investors (Existing PBSAs):
  a) For potential investors, perhaps the average rent rate would be relevant in financial evaluation
  b) The yearly admission rate between both cities is a good indicator of potential market size, and hence .... 
  c) A profile of the commercial activity of both cities may suggest what the more valuable investment would be.
  
Students:
  a) The crime rate in both cities is a major factor to consider. According to a Savills student study (*ref to be inserted*), Safety and Security were the highest ranked factor for students when choosing where to live.
  b) Information on rental price of PBSAs will also be important for a lot of students. 
  c) A social profile of both cities would be beneficial in determining quality of life and student satisfaction. Availability of things like shopping centres, restaurants, recreational activities, nightlife etc.
